# Contributing

Welcome! We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to FPsim. This document will help you get started.

- We are serious about inclusion and believe the open-source software community still has a long way to go. The FPsim community follows a [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
- Take a look at our house [style guide](https://github.com/amath-idm/styleguide). FPsim more or less follows Google's Python style guide, but with some exceptions.
- Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/fpsim/fpsim/issues/new/choose) on more or less anything! This project is small enough that we don't need a formal triage system.
- Pull requests should be made against `main`. In addition to following the [style guide](https://github.com/amath-idm/styleguide), please make sure the tests pass (`run_tests` in the `tests` folder; they also run via GitHub actions).

If you have any other questions, please reach out to us: info@starsim.org. Thank you!
